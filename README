This project aims to be a full buffer overflow mitigation test suite
mainly for mainstream linux distributions.

It is based on paxtest by Peter Busser <peter@adamantix.org>.

Usage:

What Ubuntu currently has:
cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-O2" .
make

What Ubuntu hopefully will have (under amd64):
cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-O2 -fPIC" -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-pie -fpie" .
make

Different cflags will exhibit changes in behaviour.  This is all part of the test,
it allows you to see what effect different options such as 
-DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2, -fstack-protector, -fPIC / -pie have.

Currently you need to run the executables manually to see if they crash.

TODO:
 * mprotect support (possibly need to mess with selinux to make it a fair test)
